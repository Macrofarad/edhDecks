Any X in the mana cost will be 0. On the other hand, if the card has optional additional costs (such as kicker or multikicker), you may pay those when you cast the card. If the card has mandatory additional costs (such as Momentous Fall does), you must pay those if you choose to cast the card.£4/15/2013: If a spell has restrictions on when it can be cast (for example, “Cast [this spell] only during the declare blockers step”), those restrictions may prevent you from casting it from exile during your upkeep.£4/15/2013: If you cast a spell using the madness or suspend abilities, you’re casting it from exile, not from your hand.
