The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Essence Scatter) will not.£10/1/2009: At the beginning of the end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by effects such as Stifle or Voidslime that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the ability won’t trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature if it would eventually leave the battlefield.£10/1/2009: Unearth grants haste to the creature that’s returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the exile abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of the end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.£10/1/2009: If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave the battlefield for any reason, it’s exiled instead — unless the spell or ability that’s causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it! In that case, it succeeds at exiling it. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Oblivion Ring or Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new permanent with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.£10/1/2009: Unlike the unearth ability, the chaos ability returns a creature card from a graveyard to the battlefield indefinitely.','P',NULL,'N/A','N/A','N/A',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),('198084','Immersturm','PCP','Plane — Valla','C',NULL,'0',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, that creature''s controller may have it deal damage equal to its power to any target of their choice.£Whenever you roll {K}, exile target creature, then return it to the battlefield under its owner''s control.',NULL,NULL,'Raymond Swanland','17','3.712','£10/1/2009: A plane card is treated as if its text box included “When you roll <img src="/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=pw&amp;type=symbol" alt="Planeswalk" align="absbottom" />, put this card on the bottom of its owner’s planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up.” This is called the “planeswalking ability.”£10/1/2009: A face-up plane card that’s turned face down becomes a new object with no relation to its previous existence.

You must follow timing restrictions based on the card’s type (if it’s a sorcery), as well as other restrictions (such as “Cast [this card] only before blockers are declared”). You may pay additional costs (such as kicker). Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will apply.£10/1/2009: As a spell cast with flashback resolves, it never goes to its owner’s graveyard, so abilities that trigger on cards being put in a graveyard won’t trigger. The card is exiled instead.£10/1/2009: If a spell cast by using flashback is countered, it’s still exiled rather than being put into its owner’s graveyard.£10/1/2009: If you use the flashback ability granted by Otaria to cast a split card from your graveyard, the flashback cost you pay is equal to the mana cost of the half that you’re casting.£10/1/2009: If you use the flashback ability granted by Otaria to cast a card with X in its mana cost from your graveyard, you choose the value of X as you cast it. You’ll still have to pay that X.£10/1/2009: Otaria may cause an instant or sorcery card in a graveyard to have multiple flashback abilities.
